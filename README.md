# 🕹️ GameStart

This project was created as part of my Software Developer course during my studies in Structured Programming. It is a program designed to analyze, search, and manage sales data for the GameStart video game store. The program allows users to enter as either an **admin** or a **client**, with each role having different access to the functionality of the system.

## 📂 Features
The program handles CSV files containing sales records with the following fields:
- **Idvenda**: Unique identifier for the sale
- **idCliente**: Unique identifier for the client
- **Editora**: Publisher of the purchased game
- **Categoria**: Category of the purchased game
- **Jogo**: Title of the purchased game
- **Valor**: Price of the purchased game

## 🛠️ Tools and Concepts Used
- **Functions**: To modularize the logic for searching, analyzing, and managing the data.
- **File Handling**: To read and write the sales data from and to the CSV files.
- **Arrays**: To store and process the data in memory.

## 🚀 Goals
This program was a practical exercise to enhance my understanding of:
- Reading and processing files in Java
- Managing arrays for data storage
- Implementing structured programming principles

## 📝 How to Use

   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
