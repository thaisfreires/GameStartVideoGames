# 🕹️ GameStart

This project was created as part of my Software Developer course during my studies in Structured Programming. It is a program designed to analyze, search, and manage sales data for the GameStart video game store. The program allows users to enter as either an **admin** or a **client**, with each role having different access to the functionality of the system.

## 🛠️ Tools and Concepts Used
- **Functions**: To modularize the logic for searching, analyzing, and managing the data.
- **File Handling**: To read and write the sales data from and to the CSV files.
- **Arrays**: To store and process the data in memory.

## 🚀 Goals
This program was a practical exercise to enhance my understanding of:
- Reading and processing files in Java
- Managing arrays for data storage
- Implementing structured programming principles

## 📝 How to Use
